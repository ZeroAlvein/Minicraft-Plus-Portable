HOW TO RUN THE GAME?

All you need to do is:

- Download Minicraft (whichever version or mod you wish)
- Rename .jar file to  minicraft.jar
- Place it INSIDE App folder
- And run trough Minicraft Plus.bat or Minicraft Plus.exe


HOW IT WORKS?


In App folder you have Portable version of Java and "FAKE" Appdata folder
Which game will use instead of C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming

Minicraft Plus.bat
In main folder just launch another ,bat file which is inside App folder
Called Start.bat

I used one bat file to launch another to hide Command Prompt window

Minicraft Plus.bat
You can right click any .bat file and choose edit
This way you will realize it's in fact kinda nothing else than .txt file
It just have different extension and exectures in a different way
Inside you will see lines with commands it will execute


Minicraft Plus.bat
CD "App"
wscript.exe "%CD%\InvScr.vbs" "%CD%\Start.bat"
exit

Whole process starts from folder where you launched .bat file
CD means Change Directory
In this case change it to folder named App
So basically first line is searching for App folder inside Working directory
And then and enters it

Why App is "" Quotation Marks?
In short of it If something is between "" Quotation Marks
It forces whole script to use full names removing need
To manually type them in by you
Dos by default don't like spaces neither does it like full names

Quotation marks here serves as shortcut to location
Instead of typing C:\Games\Minicraft Plus Portable\App
It shortens whole command and allow us to look for App folder
Inside working directory instead of altering path
Each time we move whole game folder to another location

For example let's say you move Minicraft Plus Portable folder to D:\ drive
Now for script to work you would need to change this part

C:\Games\Minicraft Plus Portable\App

to

D:\Minicraft Plus Portable\App

But thx to "App"

Script just adds current location Of working directory and problem solved


wscript.exe "%CD%\InvScr.vbs" "%CD%\Start.bat"

WSscrit is just Visual Basic Script which "HIDES" Command prompt window 
And that is the only reason why my method uses 2 .bat files
(Relax you already have Visual Basic on your windows
Nothing here is going to install it)

%CD% works exactly the same as Quotation Marks in "App"
Difference here is that it needs to have percentage marks followed by
Back slash because we specified certain file and not directory

InvScr.vbs is just that script which have command inside of it to hide
Command Prompt window

"%CD%\Start.bat" this part is just pointing out to .bat file
Which will actually launch the game

exit <- well maybe not obvious enough but it closes Command Prompt
AFTER finishing WHOLE script 

That is another reason why it's made into TWO .bat files and not ONE

With single .bat file script with EXIT on end would wait for script to finish
Before closing Command Prompt and wait for you to exit the game
And NOT after it launched the game

Start,bat basically just launches the game and forces game to use
That "FAKE" Appdata folder
Appdata is what it says a folder for Data of Applications
You can enter it by typing %appdata% and hitting enter
In search bar at menu start or in adres bar in any folder
(it exist so even after you unstilla application you still
Have it's setting and data for example reinstalling skype will still
Remember your login and password)

TITLE Minicraft Plus
SET APPDATA=Appdata
CD /X %~dp0
"%CD%\Java\bin\java.exe" -jar minicraft.jar .
exit

TITLE just displays name after word TITLE (in this case Minicraft Plus)
On top of Command Prompt window (yeah it's useless here)

SET APPDATA=Appdata
This line sets default system folder of Appdata to location we specified
So \Minicraft Plus Portable\App\Appdata

CD /X %~dp0
Explanation taken from Stackoverflow
cd -- This is change directory command.
/d -- This switch makes cd change both drive and directory at once
Without it you would have to do cd %~d0 & cd %~p0. (%~d0
Changes active drive, cd %~p0 change the directory).
%~dp0 -- This can be dissected further into three parts:
%0 -- This represents zeroth parameter of your batch script
It expands into the name of the batch file itself.
%~0 -- The ~ there strips double quotes (") around the expanded argument.
%dp0 -- The d and p there are modifiers of the expansion
The d forces addition of a drive letter and the p adds full path.

"%CD%\Java\bin\java.exe" -jar minicraft.jar .
In short of it java part tells script to launch .jar file with java from that location

Minecraft Plus\App\Appdata
Well here are stored all your files relating Minicraft like world or texture packs

Minecraft Plus\App\Java
I let you guess what is in here

Minecraft Plus\Data
Here are all .bat files .ico and crap i used to make this script work

I made Minicraft icon by literally taking screenshot from game
Then cutting it out in size i want in GIMP but windows paint will work just fine
Then i googled PNG to ICO online and i just converted it to icon this way

Minecraft Plus\Data\Bat to Exe Converter
This is how i made .exe file from .bat file
So yeah Minicraft Plus.exe is exact the same thing as Minicraft Plus.bat
Just converted to different format

How to use Bat to Exe Converter?
For sake of simplicity don't go for 64bit version
This whole script uses 32bit java so whats the point?

To make whole process easy place .bat and .ico files on desktop
In this case Minicraft Plus.bat NOT Start.bat
To launch bat script into it you either click Open icon on upper left
Or you simply copy and paste content of .bat file into white field
Again you can right-click and chose Edit on .bat file

Now in Bat to Exe in right part check box next to Icon:
This will allow you to select .ico file by clicking button with 3 dots ...
Right from it

In Exe-Format: choose 32bit : Windows (Invisible)

Now you just click Convert icon (Located on top) and name your .exe file
And you are done


!!!! WARNING !!!!
When i had many many .exe files made this method with older
Version of Bat to Exe and i switched to windows 10
Windows deleted all .exe files assuming they are viruses

Im now back on windows 7 so i have no idea if this was fixed or not
Since now i have newer version of Bat to Exe and that's why
There is .exe and .bat version in main folder

If exe don't work for you then just make shortcut to
Minicraft Plus.bat right click it choose properties and change it's icon
And you will have pretty much same result as making shortcut to .exe file

Minecraft Plus\Data\TexturePacks

Here are texture packs i found and one i altered for my needs
You place  .zip files from that folder into
\Minicraft Plus Portable\App\Appdata\playminicraft\mods\Minicraft_Plus\TexturePacks
And now you can change texture packs in-game

InvScr.vbs
Is script mentioned earlier to hide Command Prompt window

And i think that's pretty much it
Have fun <('.'< )
