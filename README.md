# Minicraft-Plus-Portable
Portable Launcher for Minicraft

All you need from here is download Minicraft Plus Portable.zip

Now download Minicraft .jar and rename it to minicraft.jar and place it inside App folder
From here https://playminicraft.com
Or here https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived/releases

Lastly you need portable Java

I got mine from here
https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Java%20Portable/

I picked 
jPortable_8_Update_101.paf.exe    2016-07-20    40.4 MB

Main idea here is that you need to pick one that is around 40-50 MB
I mean if you see some with 900KB then this is just online installer
Better to download standalone version which is around that 40-50 MB
And for sure NOT 64bit one you want in fact 32bit version
64bit wont hurt and will work just fine but it kinda make no sense
It's like buying 3,5 ghz 16 gb ram PC to play solitaire

Its more of self extracting file than installer
It will extract a folder from which you only need Java folder

So just click ok ok ok next next next and confirm

You will see now folder named CommonFiles open it and inside will be Java folder
Cut that Java folder and paste it into 
Minicraft Plus Portable\App

And its all done

Now just run game via Minicraft Plus.bat or Minicraft Plus.exe from Minicraft Plus Portable folder
