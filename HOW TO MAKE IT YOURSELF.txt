Here you will learn how to make this script work WITHOUT downloading anything i provide

1st download all crap you need

Google portable apps java download
I got mine from here
https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Java%20Portable/

I picked 
jPortable_8_Update_101.paf.exe    2016-07-20    40.4 MB

Main idea here is that you need to pick one that is around 40-50 MB
I mean if you see some with 900KB then this is just online installer
Better to download standalone version which is around that 40-50 MB
And for sure NOT 64bit one you want in fact 32bit version
64bit wont hurt and will work just fine but it kinda make no sense
It's like buying 3,5 ghz 16 gb ram PC to play solitaire


Next is Bat to Exe converter 3.2
You can skip this part if you dont need .exe file

I got mine from here
https://www.portablefreeware.com/?id=1660

To download just click either 32-bit or 64-bit under Bat To Exe Converter3.2.0.0
(Again no point to go for 64 bit version but it won't hurt)

You could make icon for Minicraft yourself but just google some
There are tons of free icons you can get from google

Ok now to creating folder structure

To make it simple everything you do will be on desktop

So go to your desktop and create folder called Minicraft Plus Portable
Now go inside of it and create folder and name it App
Go inside App folder and create folder and name it Appdata

And you are done with this part

Now on desktop create text file open it and paste this inside it

CD "App"
wscript.exe "%CD%\InvScr.vbs" "%CD%\Start.bat"
exit

Now its important IF YOU DON'T see file extensions by default
Click File > Save As
And in File Name on the bottom type Minicraft Plus.bat
Below it in File Type choose all files
And below it in Encoding choose Unicode

Or option B just google DOWNLOAD BAT FILE and download any
Then right Click it choose edit and paste script from above into it
And just save it normally

Now copy that .bat file and rename that copy to Start.bat
Edit it and paste this inside of it

TITLE Minicraft Plus
SET APPDATA=Appdata
CD /X %~dp0
"%CD%\Java\bin\javaw.exe" -jar minicraft.jar .
exit

Now depending on do you see extensions
So like do you see New Text File.txt or just New Text File without .exe

IF YOU SEE extensions
Just copy any .bat file and rename it to InvScr.vbs
Yes confirm changing extensions
Right click it and choose Edit then paste this line inside of it

CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run """" & WScript.Arguments(0) & """", 0, False

And just save ( CTRL + S )


IF YOU DON"T SEE extensions
Edit any .txt or .bat file and Paste this line inside of it

CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run """" & WScript.Arguments(0) & """", 0, False

Click File > Save As
In File Name on the bottom type InvScr.vbs
Below it in File Type choose all files
And below it in Encoding choose Unicode

Next step is to download Minicraft and rename it to minicraft.jar


Copy or move filles listed below into Minicraft Plus Portable\App
InvScr.vbs
minicraft.jar
Start.bat

And files from below to Minicraft Plus Portable
Minicraft Plus.bat
Minicraft Plus.exe


Converting .bat to .exe and adding icon to it

To make whole process easy place .bat and .ico files on desktop
In this case Minicraft Plus.bat NOT Start.bat
To launch bat script into it you either click Open icon on upper left
Or you simply copy and paste content of .bat file into white field
Again you can right-click and chose Edit on .bat file

Now in Bat to Exe in right part check box next to Icon:
This will allow you to select .ico file by clicking button with 3 dots ...
Right from it

In Exe-Format: choose 32bit : Windows (Invisible)

Now you just click Convert icon (Located on top) and name your .exe file
For example Minicraft Plus .exe and you are done


Onto java which you downloaded earlier just put it on desktop and run installer
Its more of self extracting file than installer
it will extract a folder into which you run that java installer

So just click ok ok ok next next next and confirm

You will see now folder named CommonFiles open it and inside will be Java folder
Cut that Java folder and paste it into 
Minicraft Plus Portable\App

And its all done

Now just either use .bat or .exe file in Minicraft Plus Portable folder to run the game

Have fun <('.'< )
